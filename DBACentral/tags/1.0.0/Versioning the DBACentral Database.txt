DBACentral will have a three part number for its version separated by dots (.).  

Example: 1.2.3
Where 1.0.0 was the fully scripted out DBACentral database

And 1.1.0 means that there was a structural change.  All difference/delta scripts must be included
to increment the database from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0.  1.2.0 will require all of the difference scripts
from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0.

And 1.0.1 means that there was a non-structural change to the database.  This might include a 
backwards compatible change to one of the collector scripts or a data change.  No delta scripts required.


The version will be stamped on the database in the form of an extended property.  All difference
scripts should interrogate the extended property and only apply if the version is as expected.
